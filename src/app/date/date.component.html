<div>
    <p>date works!</p>
    <p>The date is:</p>
    <p id="jsPara"><strong>{{ dateMessage }}</strong></p>
</div>

<!-- CLI doesn't always pull values from app-component eg:-->
Two number addition :  
{{1+3}}
<br><br>

<!-- Combination of one data member pull + local value eg: -->
A data member variable and a number addition : 
{{sampleNumber+5}}
<br><br>

<!-- A member function/ Method could also be called here eg: -->
Method calling : 
{{addTwoNumbers(10,20)}}
<br><br>

<!-- data member can also be send in method calls eg: -->
Member variable passing in Method calls : 
{{addTwoNumbers(sampleNumber,50)}}

<!-- Note: addTwoNumbers(simpleNumber,50) within {{}} above is not a TypeScript code as it wont work in .ts flle -->

<!-- To use it within TypeScript code we have to write "this" keyword
 but not needed in Markup(HTML)
    methodName()
 {
     this.addTwoNumbers(this.sampleNumber,50)
 }
